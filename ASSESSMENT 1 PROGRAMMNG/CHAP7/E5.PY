# Exercise 5: Cities

#Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, 

#such as Reykjavik is in Iceland. Give the parameter for the country a default value.

#Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the default country.

    """Prints a simple sentence about the city and its country."""
    print(f"{city} is in {country}.")

describe_city("Reykjavik")  
describe_city("Abu Dhabi", "United Arab Emirates") 
describe_city("Rabat", "Morocco")
