# Exercise 2: Movie Tickets: :ballot_box_with_check:

#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if

#they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their 

#age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket

while True:
    age = input("Enter your age (or type 'quit' to exit): ")
    if age.lower() == 'quit':
        print("Thank you! Have a great day!")
        break
    age = int(age)
    if age < 3:
        print("The ticket is free.\n")
    elif 3 <= age <= 12:
        print("The ticket is $10.\n")
    else:
        print("The ticket is $15.\n")
